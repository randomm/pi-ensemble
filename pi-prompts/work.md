# Work: Execute GitHub Issue(s)

**Issue**: $ARGUMENTS

If no issue number provided, ask.

---

## Capabilities

- Up to **10 async parallel slots** via `dispatch_parallel`. Never serialise independent work.
- **Worktrees are cheap scratch space.** Multiple developers run in parallel worktrees; cherry-pick into ONE feature branch → ONE PR → ONE CI run.
- **Developer never commits.** Returns with uncommitted changes in the worktree. `ops` commits.
- **Adversarial gate is mandatory.** After every developer dispatch, run `adversarial_loop` on the resulting diff. `ops` does not commit until `adversarial_loop` returns APPROVED.

## Scratch hygiene — agents NEVER pollute the repo root

Any ephemeral artefacts (diff snapshots between adversarial rounds, captured screenshots, one-off verification scripts, analysis JSON, PR-body files you pass to `gh pr create --body-file`) go under **`<repo>/tmp/issue-<N>/`** (project-local, gitignored via `.git/info/exclude`, NOT a committed `.gitignore` entry) OR `/tmp/pi-ensemble-<role>/` (host-level).

The work-driver creates `<repo>/tmp/issue-<N>/` and adds `/tmp/` to `.git/info/exclude` on cycle start automatically; under the legacy PM-driven flow (PI_ENSEMBLE_WORK_DRIVER=0) you (PM) must create it yourself before the first dispatch:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/issue-$ARGUMENTS
grep -q '^/tmp/' .git/info/exclude 2>/dev/null || echo '/tmp/' >> .git/info/exclude
```

Pass the absolute path of this dir into every developer/ops/explore dispatch prompt — *"scratch goes under `/abs/path/tmp/issue-<N>/`"*. Empirical pattern from nessie issue #553: previous cycles left 12 dot-prefixed diff files (`.pr503_r2.diff`, `.regate-512.diff` …), abandoned screenshots, e2e scripts, and a 2.3 GB core dump at the repo root — the next /work's branch step then ABORTed correctly on a dirty tree.

## Parallelism mode (default)

**Default to parallel.** At every step below, identify what can run concurrently and dispatch multiple tools in the SAME PM turn. Skip parallelism only when the next dispatch literally depends on prior output (e.g., Step 3's branch name → Step 4's worktree path).

Trust your judgment, but bias hard toward parallel. The live dispatch deck (footer) shows you what's actually in flight — use it to confirm you've fanned out when you intended to.

Concrete defaults this command expects you to exploit:

- **Step 1**: `gh issue view` (your own bash call) PLUS dispatch `explore` IN THE SAME TURN. Do NOT wait for explore before continuing your own reads.
- **Step 4**: `developer` (one per workstream) PLUS just-in-time `explore` if the developer might benefit from related context (test patterns at the touchpoints, related API surface, prior similar fixes). Do NOT wait for explore to finish — its report arrives alongside the developer's.
- **Step 7**: the lens review fans out 6 children automatically via `dispatch_lens_review`.

If a step truly doesn't decompose into parallel work (e.g., Step 5's adversarial gate is sequential by design — `adversarial_loop` IS the parallel unit), just do it sequentially. Bias toward parallel, not religious adherence.

## How dispatch works (read once)

All dispatch tools are async: they return a `{ jobId }` handle in < 100ms. The subagent's final report arrives later as a user message starting with `[ensemble:async]`. After dispatching, **end your turn with a one-line summary** unless you have other parallel work — the user can interact freely while children run. React to the `[ensemble:async]` report when it arrives. Never read transcript files under `~/.pi/agent/ensemble-runs/` — those are user-only. Before declaring the workflow done at the end, call `dispatch_status` to confirm no children are still running.

---

## Step 1 — Read the issue and project context (parallel)

**In ONE PM turn**: run `gh issue view` AND dispatch `explore` — do not wait for explore before continuing.

```bash
gh issue view "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Simultaneously dispatch `explore` via `dispatch_specialist`:
- **Discover memory types first** (vipune types are project-defined, not fixed): `vipune list --json | jq -r '.[] | .memory_type' | sort -u` (If this command fails, skip `--memory-type` filtering and proceed with `--hybrid` searches only.) (If you've already discovered this project's memory types earlier in this session, reuse them — skip re-running discovery.)
- `vipune search "<keyword>" --hybrid --recency <0.0-1.0> --limit 8-10` — prior decisions. Derive conceptual keywords from the issue title/body and run a focused search per keyword. Use `--hybrid` for semantic + BM25 fusion. Vary `--recency` by intent: `0.0-0.3` for foundational knowledge, `0.9` for "what's happening lately". Use your judgment for what's worth searching. Avoid passing the whole issue as a single query — vipune prefers short phrases.
- `codebase_memory_search_code({query: "<concept>"})` — find existing code that implements something described in the issue. **Code-only** semantic search over the indexed repo; the query must describe something you'd expect to find in source files (e.g. `"JWT validation"`, `"retry on HTTP 5xx"`, `"users table migration"`). Do not use it for meta-questions like `"project architecture"` — use `codebase_memory_get_architecture` for that.

On timeout (120 seconds) or incomplete explore response, apply the Reconnaissance Doctrine timeout and resilience fallback.

## Step 2 — Decompose and plan

Identify parallel workstreams. Decide worktree strategy:
- Single task → single feature branch, no worktrees.
- Multiple independent tasks → worktrees as scratch, cherry-pick into one branch.

## Step 3 — Setup

Delegate to `ops` via `dispatch_specialist`. The ops prompt MUST explicitly require these preconditions before creating the feature branch:

1. **Identify the mainline branch.** Default `main`; if the repo uses a different convention (`master`, `develop`, `trunk`, etc.) detect via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'`.
2. **Verify clean working tree.** `git status --porcelain` must be empty. If dirty, ABORT and surface to PM — do NOT branch off uncommitted work.
3. **Fetch and fast-forward the mainline.** `git fetch origin && git checkout <mainline> && git pull --ff-only origin <mainline>`. If `--ff-only` fails (mainline diverged), ABORT and surface to PM.
4. **Create feature branch** `feature/issue-{N}-brief-description` from that fresh mainline tip.
5. **Create worktrees if parallelising** (`.worktrees/task-A`, `.worktrees/task-B`). Ensure `.worktrees/` is in `.gitignore`.

Never silently branch off stale or dirty state. If any precondition fails, ops surfaces the failure verbatim and PM stops the workflow to ask the user.

## Step 4 — Implementation (parallel-first)

**In ONE PM turn**, dispatch concurrently using all relevant slots:

1. **Implementation** — for N independent workstreams: ONE `dispatch_parallel` call with one developer spec per worktree. For a single workstream: `dispatch_specialist developer`.
2. **Just-in-time context** — if the developer might benefit from context Step 1's explore didn't cover (test patterns at the touchpoints, related API surface, prior similar fixes), dispatch `explore` in the SAME TURN. Its report arrives alongside the developer's; synthesise both when the batch reports back.
3. **Skip parallel-explore only when** the developer task is trivially clear and there is nothing useful explore could surface in time. PM judgment.

Do NOT serialise: do NOT dispatch explore, wait for its report, then dispatch developer. Dispatch both in one turn.

Required developer prompt fields:
- **Task**: one-line directive ("Implement issue #N: <brief>")
- **Context**: 1-3 sentence framing
- **Issue text**: **full issue body verbatim from `gh issue view`** (acceptance criteria, DoD, etc.) — without it the developer works to a paraphrased spec
- **Worktree path** and branch name
- **Files in scope** (when known) — discourages drive-by edits
- Explicit instruction: "list changed files and return; do not attempt git commands."

`developer` returns with uncommitted changes in the worktree. `ops` does not commit until Step 5's adversarial gate passes.

## Step 5 — Adversarial gate (MANDATORY)

When the developer(s) return, gate the diff with `adversarial_loop` before any commit:

1. Obtain the diff:
   - Worktree: `git -C .worktrees/task-A diff`
   - Main wd: `git diff`
2. Call `adversarial_loop` with `diff`, `context` (include the same issue text given to the developer — the adversarial verifies against acceptance criteria), and `workCwd`.
3. On APPROVED → Step 6.
4. On rejection after 3 internal rounds → halt and surface the verdict text to the user.

The `adversarial_loop` tool encapsulates a 3-round review-then-fix cycle: each rejection spawns a fresh developer to address the findings, then re-reviews. PM does not orchestrate the internal rounds — one tool call returns the final verdict.

## Step 6 — Commit and PR

Dispatch `ops`:
- Single task: `git add` + `git commit` from main wd.
- Multi-task: commit from each worktree, cherry-pick into the feature branch, then `git worktree remove`.
- Push feature branch.
- `gh pr create` with `Fixes #N` in the body.

## Step 7 — Six-pass code review (MANDATORY)

**Initialise round tracking + wall-clock cap**: `review_round = 1` on first entry. Call `check_review_cap` with `key: "issue-${N}"` (or `pr-${N}`) and `reset: true` to start the 90-min wall-clock timer in extension state — this is the deterministic source of truth; do not try to track wall-clock yourself.

**Fetch the PR diff ONCE** and reuse it for the lens review and any subsequent retry rounds:

```bash
gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER"        # or: git diff main...feature/issue-N
```

Call the `dispatch_lens_review` tool with `diff`, optional `context` (1-3 sentence summary of the change), and optional `cwd`. The tool fans out six parallel `code-review-specialist` children — one per lens (SECURITY, ERROR_HANDLING, TYPE_SAFETY, PERFORMANCE, ARCHITECTURE, SIMPLICITY) — each pinned to its skill via `--no-skills --skill <path>`. Findings are deduped by `(path, line, title)`, precedence-merged (SECURITY > ERROR_HANDLING > TYPE_SAFETY > PERFORMANCE > ARCHITECTURE > SIMPLICITY), and a verdict is computed:

- **APPROVED** (no findings, or only LOW) → proceed to Step 8.
- **ISSUES_FOUND** (any HIGH or MEDIUM) → enter the fix loop below.
- **CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND** (any CRITICAL) → enter the fix loop below; treat as highest priority; user override is NOT permitted for CRITICAL.

### Step 7f — Fix loop (when verdict is not APPROVED)

Run the following cycle, incrementing `review_round` after each complete pass:

1. **Consolidate findings**: take the `findings` array from the tool's `details`. Group by file. For each file, summarise what needs fixing (title, severity, suggestion).

2. **Dispatch `developer` to fix** via `dispatch_specialist`. Required prompt fields:
   - Task: "Address the six-pass review findings below against the diff currently on this worktree. Make the minimal change per finding. Run local quality gates before declaring complete. Do NOT touch unrelated code."
   - Context: "Six-pass review round N fix pass; lens findings below."
   - Findings list verbatim (severity, file:line, title, suggestion per finding) — this is the developer's checklist.
   - Worktree path (same as Step 4).

3. **Re-run the adversarial gate** (Step 5): call `adversarial_loop` with the post-fix diff and the consolidated findings as `context`. If the loop rejects after its own 3 internal rounds, halt and produce the handoff artifact (Step 7g) — do NOT ask the user for guidance.

4. **Re-fetch diff** after the adversarial gate passes: `git -C <worktree> diff` or `gh pr diff <N>` if changes were committed.

5. **Re-run this step** (Step 7) by calling `dispatch_lens_review` again with the new diff.

6. **Check loop caps** BEFORE starting the next round:
   - If `review_round > 3` → halt and produce the handoff artifact (Step 7g). Do NOT ask the user for guidance.
   - Call `check_review_cap` with `key: "issue-${N}"` (no `reset`). If `ok: false`, halt and produce the handoff artifact (Step 7g). Do NOT ask the user for guidance.

### Step 7g — Cap-hit handoff artifact (no user-block)

When any cap fires (Step 7f.3 adversarial-loop rejection, Step 7f.6 round-cap, Step 7f.6 wall-clock cap), PM produces a **structured handoff artifact** and stops cleanly. Caps are deterministic stop signals, not questions: rounds 4+ produce diminishing returns by design, and blocking on user yes/no leaves the team idle waiting for a binary that the data already answered.

**Before finalising the handoff, classify the failure pattern.** Look at the consolidated findings across all rounds:

- **Orthogonal local bugs** (different findings in each round, no clear theme) → proceed directly to the handoff artifact below
- **Recurring theme** (same lens repeatedly flags the same kind of issue; or the developer keeps "fixing" something that the reviewer keeps re-rejecting in the same shape) → **dispatch the step-back** before the handoff (Step 7h below)

### Step 7h — Step-back dispatch (only when findings cluster around a theme)

When findings recur around a theme, the failure category is likely spec-level, not implementation-level (MAST: 41.77% of multi-agent failures are spec-level; no amount of worker-side retry fixes that class). Dispatch ONE `@explore` with a Step-Back-framed prompt that asks which of the six SDD spec elements is underspecified — before finalising the handoff. The `@explore` analysis then gets included in the handoff so the user sees a thesis, not just findings.

Use `dispatch_specialist` with `role: explore`. The prompt template:

```
Don't review THIS diff. Take a step back and consider whether the SPEC has a problem.

Original issue: <link to issue or quote the spec>
Recurring rejection pattern across <N> rounds: <summary of the theme>
Findings cluster: <verbatim 2-4 findings that show the pattern>

Which of these six SDD spec elements appears underspecified?
  1. Outcomes — acceptance criteria, what "done" looks like
  2. Scope boundaries — what's in / out of scope
  3. Constraints — technical / system / invariants
  4. Prior decisions — why X was chosen over Y; what previous decisions
     this depends on
  5. Task breakdown — sub-task structure, ordering, dependencies
  6. Verification criteria — what proves it's done

Return:
- which element is underspecified (one of the six)
- one-sentence diagnosis
- concrete proposed spec edit (verbatim text to add to the issue body)
- alternative approach if applicable
```

When `@explore` returns:

- Include its analysis verbatim in the handoff PR-comment under a "Step-back analysis" heading
- Draft a "Proposed spec revision" section using `@explore`'s concrete edit, as a quoted diff against the current issue body
- Surface to user via the standard handoff mechanism — user reviews the proposed spec revision and decides whether to approve / modify / reject

This adds ONE extra `@explore` dispatch on cap-hits where the pattern suggests structural issue — cheap insurance against handing the user a wall of findings without a thesis. When the pattern is orthogonal bugs (no theme), skip this step and go directly to the bare handoff.

Handoff artifact has three pieces:

1. **PR comment** (use `gh pr comment <N> --body-file -` if a PR exists; otherwise `gh issue comment <N> --body-file -`). Body shape:

   ```markdown
   ## ⏸ Cap hit — needs human attention

   **Cap**: <which cap fired: adversarial-loop / round-cap / wall-clock>
   **Rounds**: <review_round> of 3
   **Worktree**: <path>

   ### What was attempted
   <1-3 bullets summarising the fix attempts>

   ### Recurring finding pattern
   <if findings cluster around a theme, name it; if orthogonal local bugs, say so>

   ### Step-back analysis (only if step-back dispatched per Step 7h)
   <verbatim @explore output identifying which of the six SDD spec
   elements is underspecified + diagnosis>

   ### Proposed spec revision (only if step-back dispatched)
   <quoted diff against the current issue body, derived from @explore's
   recommended-change; user reviews and approves/modifies/rejects>

   ### Suggested next steps
   <1-2 concrete options; e.g. "approve the proposed spec revision and
   re-enter from /plan", "rescope to defer the X requirement", "user
   reviews the diff manually">

   ### Transcripts
   <transcript paths from the [ensemble:async] reports verbatim>
   ```

2. **GitHub label**: `gh pr edit <N> --add-label needs-human-attention` (or `gh issue edit <N> --add-label needs-human-attention`). If the label doesn't exist in the repo, create it first via `gh label create needs-human-attention --color FFAA00 --description "Agent loop hit a cap; human review required"`.

3. **End-of-turn scrollback line**: one sentence + link to the comment. Example:

   ```
   ⏸ /work halted at adversarial round-cap on issue #123 — handoff comment: https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/pull/<N>#issuecomment-<id>
   ```

**Then stop.** Do not ask the user "what should I do next?" The handoff artifact IS the answer. User reviews the PR comment when they're back at the desk.

**User override paths** (rare, only when user EXPLICITLY tells PM to proceed past a cap, only for verdicts ≤ ISSUES_FOUND, never for CRITICAL):
- Option A: continue to Step 8 with the lens issues unresolved. Requires explicit "yes" confirmation FROM THE USER (not PM asking — user volunteering). Record the override in vipune: `vipune add 'override issue #N PR#M: [lens names] bypassed. Reason: [user-provided]'`.
- Option B: user manually addresses the remaining findings and confirms ready to proceed.

Per-lens transcripts auto-save under `~/.pi/agent/ensemble-runs/` for the **user's** post-hoc inspection. Do NOT read them yourself — that bloats your context and re-imports content the lens-review tool already returned to you in summarised form.

### Step 7e — Mandatory observability output

After Step 7f resolves (APPROVED, halted, or overridden), print a status line of the form:

```
six-pass review · round <N> of 3 · verdict <APPROVED|ISSUES_FOUND|CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND>
transcripts: <copy the `transcripts` block from the [ensemble:async] report verbatim>
```

so the user can see exactly how many rounds ran and where to find the per-lens detail. The `[ensemble:async]` report from `dispatch_lens_review` already contains the transcript paths — surface them verbatim, do not synthesise.

## Step 8 — CI monitoring

Dispatch `ops` to run `gh run watch`. On failure, dispatch `developer` with the CI failure summary as the task and the same worktree, then re-run the adversarial gate (Step 5) on the resulting diff. If any code changed, loop back to Step 7 (six-pass review) before re-attempting CI.

On green CI + APPROVED review: merge per project merge policy.

## Step 9 — Store learnings

```bash
vipune add 'issue #N: [decision/pattern discovered]'
```

## Principles

- **Parallel first** — at every step, ask "what else can run alongside this?" Dispatch in one PM turn, end with a one-line status. Never serialise independent work.
- **Trust PM judgment** — skip parallelism only when the next dispatch literally depends on prior output.
- **Use the deck** — the footer shows what's in flight. If you intended to fan out and only see one row, you serialised by accident.
- Worktrees are temporary scratch.
- One PR per issue.
- Developer hands off with uncommitted changes — `ops` commits.
- Adversarial gate is not optional — `adversarial_loop` runs after every developer dispatch, before `ops` commits.
