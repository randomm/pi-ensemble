## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-19

Initial alpha release.

Tested against `pi` (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) **0.75.3**.

### Added

- **Five slash commands** for the project-manager workflow:
  `/start`, `/research`, `/plan`, `/work`, `/review`.
- **Three utility commands**: `/ensemble-debug` (config introspection),
  `/ensemble-model` (interactive per-role model picker, persisted to
  `~/.pi/agent/ensemble-models.json`), `/runs` (browse subagent transcripts).
- **Six specialist roles** with separate system prompts assembled from
  `agents-base/` + `modules/` + `manifests/`: project-manager, developer,
  ops, explore, adversarial-developer, code-review-specialist.
- **Parallel dispatch** — `dispatch_specialist` and `dispatch_parallel` tools
  spawn role-pinned child Pi processes via `Promise.all`. Up to 10 concurrent.
- **Adversarial gate** — mandatory `adversarial_loop` tool runs up to 3 rounds
  of adversarial review + developer fix before code can be committed.
- **Six-pass code review** — `dispatch_lens_review` tool fans out one
  `code-review-specialist` per lens (SECURITY, ERROR_HANDLING, TYPE_SAFETY,
  PERFORMANCE, ARCHITECTURE, SIMPLICITY), each pinned to its lens-specific
  skill via `--skill <path>`. Findings come back as schema-validated
  `report_finding` tool calls; the parent deduplicates by `(path, line, title)`,
  applies precedence (SECURITY > ERROR_HANDLING > TYPE_SAFETY > PERFORMANCE >
  ARCHITECTURE > SIMPLICITY), and computes a verdict
  (APPROVED / ISSUES_FOUND / CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND).
- **Per-child transcripts** persisted to
  `~/.pi/agent/ensemble-runs/<date>/<runId>-<role>[-<tag>].json`. Replay with
  `pi --session <path>` or browse via `/runs`.
- **Model resolution** with five-layer priority: per-call override → saved
  per-role config → saved all-subagents config → `PI_ENSEMBLE_MODEL_<ROLE>`
  env var → `PI_ENSEMBLE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` env var → Pi default.
- **19 bundled skills** under `skill/` covering Python, Rust, Rails,
  React/React-Native, Go, shell, Postgres, devops, doc-maturity, the six
  code-review lenses, and more. Symlinked into `~/.pi/agent/skills/` at
  install time.
- **Modular prompt build** via `build.sh` — 28 reusable modules under
  `modules/` compose into six per-role system prompts. Single source of
  truth for vipune doctrine, output standards, async-task discipline,
  worktree workflow, quality gates, etc.

### Known limitations

- No per-role tool allowlists yet — specialists inherit Pi's default
  permissions. Use a sandbox repo until comfortable with how the model
  behaves. Tracked as a post-launch issue (planned integration:
  `@randomm/pi-permissions`).
- Worktree management uses raw `git worktree …` calls. Migration to the
  safer `@randomm/pi-worktree` programmatic API is planned.
- Six-pass review has no per-lens retry. If a lens fails to spawn or
  returns non-zero, that lens contributes zero findings but does not block
  the verdict.
