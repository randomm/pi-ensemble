 * Extracted from work-driver-handoff-markdown.ts (AGENTS.md §12 file-size
 * limit) — same split pattern as work-driver-adversarial-reentry.ts: pure
 * formatter primitives, value-imported one way, type-only the other, no
 * runtime cycle.
 *
 * The handoff body must tell the operator what the adversarial gate
 * ACTUALLY decided — the rounds that ran and what the reviewer objected to —
 * and it must keep the no-verdict infra-failure states distinct from a
 * genuine rejection (#478: an infra death in round 1's fix dispatch was
 * reported as "3 adversarial round(s), all rejected").
 *
 * - `adversarialRoundsLine` — the **Rounds** line, per the cap that fired.
 * - `adversarialOutcomeSection` — the reviewer's findings, or the explicit
 *   "no review rejection exists" body when the gate died on infrastructure.
