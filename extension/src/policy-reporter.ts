/**
 * Companion Pi extension loaded into the policy-judge child process (#407).
 *
 * Registers a single `report_policy` tool. The judge reads a project's
 * doctrine files, answers one yes/no policy question, and reports the answer
 * through this tool — never through prose.
 *
 * The reason this is a tool call rather than a marker line in the reply is the
 * whole point of #407. The gate it replaces was three regexes over `AGENTS.md`,
 * and they failed on real files: nessie's *"Agents may squash-merge **a** PR to
 * main"* missed because the pattern wanted `PRs` immediately after `merge`, and
 * this repo's own `does NOT merge to main` escaped the deny matcher because the
 * pattern wanted `do not`. A regex also silently assumes the operator writes
 * English. Pi validates this schema inside the child, so — as with
 * `report_finding` — malformed calls never reach the parent, and there is no
 * text-parsing failure class left to harden.
 *
 * The judge is NOT trusted. Its answer is a claim, and `work-driver-policy.ts`
 * verifies the `quote` appears verbatim in the file the judge named before any
 * permission is granted. See that module for why.
