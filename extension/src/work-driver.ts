/**
 * /work driver — the deterministic orchestrator for compiled /work cycles.
 *
 * Replaces PM-as-orchestrator with code-as-orchestrator for /work (and ONLY
 * /work — /research, /audit, /plan, /review, /start stay prose-driven; see
 * the plan file's command taxonomy table). The driver:
 *
 *   1. owns the step transition table (walked from `pi-prompts/work.md`),
 *   2. dispatches subagents directly via `dispatchCore()` (ownerKind:driver),
 *   3. persists every transition to `.pi/work-state/<issue>.json` via
 *      `writeState()`,
 *   4. surfaces step-level progress to the user by `pi.sendUserMessage()` —
 *      PM stays as the chat-side reporter, not the loop runner.
 *
 * ## Design axioms (from the determinism research synthesis)
 *
 * - **TS owns transitions; prose owns judgement.** The driver routes on
 *   structured-output fields produced by subagents (e.g.,
 *   `adversarial_loop` returns "APPROVED"/"ISSUES_FOUND"/"CRITICAL"). Fuzzy
 *   doctrine like "findings cluster around a theme" is decided by an
 *   @explore step-back call that returns a structured spec-element
 *   identification, not by the driver inferring themes.
 *
 * - **Driver-owned dispatch.** Every dispatch uses
 *   `dispatchCore(pi, spec, { … })` which sets `ownerKind:"driver"` so the
 *   async-jobs steer back to PM is skipped. The driver awaits the
 *   completion promise and routes the result through its own state
 *   machine. PM never sees an `[ensemble:async]` it didn't ask for.
 *
 * - **Resume-on-restart, NOT resume-of-in-flight.** v1 is observational:
 *   if the Pi process dies mid-dispatch, the driver on restart detects an
 *   orphan `dispatch-started` event in the log without a matching
 *   completion and HALTS, asking the user to inspect the worktree. Auto-
 *   replay of partial dispatches is a v2 concern (would require async-jobs
 *   to durably journal too).
 *
 * - **Cap-state lives in the work-state file.** `reviewRound` and
 *   `reviewCapStartedAt` are persisted to `pipelineState`; the driver
 *   enforces caps directly without going through the legacy
 *   `check_review_cap` tool. The tool remains for PM-driven /work cycles
 *   (PI_ENSEMBLE_WORK_DRIVER=0 fallback).
 *
 * ## Feature flag
 *
 * `PI_ENSEMBLE_WORK_DRIVER=0` bypasses the driver entirely and falls back
 * to the legacy PM-driven flow (`pi.sendUserMessage(work.md)`). Default is
 * ON in v1. See `commands.ts:registerCommands` for the dispatch.
 *
 * ## Status: skeleton
 *
 * This file is the loop scaffolding + state-machine table + a small set of
 * step implementations. The full 9-step build out (concrete step templates
 * for develop, adversarial, lens-review, lens-fix, step-back, commit-pr,
 * ci, merged + the corresponding `runStep` cases) is staged in follow-up
 * commits on the same branch. Each step's `runStep` case is annotated with
 * `TODO(work-driver-pr1)` where the concrete behaviour is pending so the
 * commit landing it can grep and find every gap.

 *
 * The fix is a routing classifier: when a step body's tail event is
 * `dispatch-failed` (or `dispatch-failed-provider`), the driver loop
 * consults this table BEFORE calling `nextStep()`:
 *
 *  - **HALT**: synthesise a cap-hit `step-failed:<step>` (or the special

 *    timeout marker), set `status='aborted'`, route to handoff. There
 *    is no useful downstream past a HALT failure.
 *  - **RETRY_ONCE**: re-run the same step body once. Idempotent steps
 *    (adversarial loop against a stable diff, lens-review 6-way fanout)
 *    can absorb transient provider transport errors. Second failure
 *    HALTs via the same path.
 *  - **DEGRADED_OK**: the existing fall-through to `nextStep()` is fine.
 *    Step-back (informational) and the terminal steps (handoff, merged)
 *    fit here.

 * The verdict paths (adversarial-rejected → cap-hit handoff, lens

 * first principle, exploiting up to 10 parallel slots for multi-
 * workstream issues (e.g., "fix bug X in frontend AND update docs"
 * would dispatch two developers in two worktrees concurrently).
 *
 * The decomposition prompt is cribbed from `pi-prompts/plan.md` Phase 2
 * — explore-shaped, structured output. The subagent reads the cached
 * issue body (from Step 1's `issueBodyArtifact`) plus the explore
 * report and decides whether the issue contains 1, 2, or N+
 * independent workstreams. Returns a fenced `## Workstreams` block
 * the driver parses.
 *
 * Single-workstream is `N=1` of the same code path (not a separate
 * branch): a `default` workstream is always written so downstream
 * code can iterate `Object.keys(workstreams)` uniformly.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *  - parsing returns 0 workstreams → write the synthetic `default`
 *  - dispatch fails → treat as halt (the cycle can't proceed without
