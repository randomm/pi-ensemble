/**
 * plan-driver — the compiled five-phase /plan pipeline (orchestrator).
 *
 * /plan used to be a 473-line prose body sent into PM's context. PM was then
 * left to run the five phases by hand, with a self-judged "triviality test"
 * and no gate between that self-judgment and `gh issue create`. In one
 * session PM filed three non-trivial issues inline (#591, #592, #594) — no
 * adversarial gap gate, no user confirmation, no structured spec body for
 * /work to consume.
 *
 * This module is the same shape as the `start_work_driver` fix: a compiled
 * driver PM calls, not a prose flow PM re-implements. It replaces the /plan
 * body, and the mode-independent issue-creation guard (issue-creation-guard.ts)
 * is what makes the replacement safe: direct `gh issue create` bash is
 * refused for every role in every mode, so the only way left to file a
 * ticket is this driver or a human typing the command themselves.
 *
 * Phase compilation (mechanical vs dispatched):
 *
 *   Phase 0 Classify   — regex on the descriptor (or the `type` param)
 *                        [plan-types.ts]
 *   Phase 1 Inventory  — vipune + `gh issue list` run by the driver; one
 *                        explore dispatch for duplicate risk
 *                        [plan-draft.ts: mechanicalInventory]
 *   Phase 2 Investigate — type-specialised explore set, all in parallel
 *                        [plan-draft.ts: anglePromptsFor]
 *   Phase 3 Draft      — the driver assembles the structured body
 *                        [plan-draft.ts: draftSpec]
 *   Phase 4 Gap gate   — one adversarial-developer dispatch per round;
 *                        CRITICAL-only terminal rule (#664 transposed):
 *                        CRITICAL gets ONE corrective round, HIGH no longer
 *                        triggers re-drafting (the gate is non-deterministic
 *                        on identical input — "fix the gaps and re-run" is
 *                        not convergent). The cap ROUTES (D2): zero CRITICAL
 *                        remaining → file with residual HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
 *                        disclosed in the existing "## Residual gap-gate
 *                        findings" section; CRITICAL remains → surface.
 *                        Cap reason is DISCRIMINATED (D1): residual-high /
 *                        residual-medium-low both route to file; unresolved-
 *                        blocking means CRITICAL remains. ABSENT verdict with
 *                        CRITICAL → NEEDS_ITERATION (D3, verdictParsed).
 *                        PI_ENSEMBLE_PLAN_GAP_GATE=0 skips for chore/spike.
 *   Phase 5 File       — the forge adapter's issueCreate (child process,
 *                        exempt from the tool_call guard by construction,
 *                        exactly like work-driver-commit's `gh pr create`).
 *                        A filing failure carries a DISCRIMINATED reason on
 *                        the result (D7) — forge-unresolved, create-error
 *                        (with the forge stderr), empty-url — plus the
 *                        deliberate-skip case for the all-angles-failed halt.
 *
 * dryRun is the confirmation seam: `dryRun: true` returns the spec + gaps
 * without filing; PM shows it to the operator; on confirmation the driver
 * is re-called with `dryRun` omitted.
