 * advanced. On nessie #553, a developer SIGTERM at 30 min cascaded into
 * 2h31m of adversarial review against partial work, then 40 min of
 * provider-timeouting handoff. ~4 hours wasted, opaque outcome.
 *
 * The fix is a routing classifier: when a step body's tail event is
 * `dispatch-failed` (or `dispatch-failed-provider`), the driver loop
 * consults this table BEFORE calling `nextStep()`:
 *
 *  - **HALT**: synthesise a cap-hit `step-failed:<step>` (or the special
 *    `developer-timeout` shape when the errorTail matches the spawn
 *    timeout marker), set `status='aborted'`, route to handoff. There
 *    is no useful downstream past a HALT failure.
 *  - **RETRY_ONCE**: re-run the same step body once. Idempotent steps
 *    (adversarial loop against a stable diff, lens-review 6-way fanout)
 *    can absorb transient provider transport errors. Second failure
 *    HALTs via the same path.
 *  - **DEGRADED_OK**: the existing fall-through to `nextStep()` is fine.
 *    Step-back (informational) and the terminal steps (handoff, merged)
 *    fit here.
 *
 * The verdict paths (adversarial-rejected → cap-hit handoff, lens
 * round-cap → handoff) are unchanged — those route correctly already.
 * This table only governs dispatch-failed at the step level.
