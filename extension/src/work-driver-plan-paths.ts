 * parallel. Nothing checked: a repo-wide grep for `overlap|disjoint|intersect`
 * found no workstream-level check anywhere, and the only Jaccard logic groups
 * *issues*, not workstreams.
 *
 * The collision surfaced much later, as a bare `git apply` failure during
 * commit-pr consolidation — a HALT step, after the whole develop and
 * adversarial spend, with an error saying nothing about why two workstreams
 * wanted the same file.
 *
 * Not hypothetical: measured on this host, current cycles are routinely N>1
