/**
 * work-driver-plan-paths — plan-quality checks on per-workstream `paths`.
 *
 * Two structural defects, both invisible at plan time and both paying for
 * themselves at commit-pr consolidation:
 *
 * 1. A COLLISION: two workstreams claim the same file. `runDevelop` fans one
 *    developer per workstream into its own worktree, so two declared `paths`
 *    lists naming the same file is two developers editing it in parallel.
 *    The only Jaccard logic in the driver groups *issues*, not workstreams;
 *    nothing checked this. The collision surfaced as a bare `git apply`
 *    failure during consolidation — a HALT step, after the whole develop and
 *    adversarial spend.
 *
 * 2. A COUPLING split (#479 / #483): a test and the file it exercises are
 *    declared by DIFFERENT workstreams. Each workstream then passes its own
 *    develop gate against its own tree, and the consolidated verify fails
 *    later, for the same reason. Measured live on issue #479: task-a owned
 *    `build.sh`, task-b owned only the test asserting on it.
 *
 * Not hypothetical: measured on this host, current cycles are routinely N>1
 * (nessie 664 = 3 workstreams, 673 = 2, 677 = 3).

 * The issue's naming inference: `test-<x>.ts` is coupled to `<x>.ts`, or a

 *
 * Mechanically: strip the leading `test-` and the extension from the test's
 * basename to get its STEM, then decompose the stem into tokens on `[-_.]`
 * (`build-list-dedup` → `build`, `list`, `dedup`). The subject path COUPLES
 * to the test when at least one of the stem's tokens EQUALS the ENTIRE
 * basename of the subject (the subject's name, not just a token of it). This
 * is the tightest inference that still catches the issue's fixture:
 *
 *   - `build.sh` vs `test-build-list-dedup.ts`
 *     subject basename: `build`; stem tokens: `build`, `list`, `dedup`.
 *     `build` ∈ stem tokens → COUPLED. ✓ (the issue's own fixture)
 *
 *   - `src/foo.ts` vs `smoke-tests/test-foobar.ts`
 *     subject basename: `foo`; stem tokens: `foobar`.
 *     `foo` ∉ `{foobar}` → NOT coupled. ✓
 *     (a test named `test-foobar.ts` is about `foobar.ts`, a different module)
 *
 *   - `src/vipune.ts` vs `smoke-tests/test-vipune-seam-live.ts`
 *     subject basename: `vipune`; stem tokens: `vipune`, `seam`, `live`.
 *     `vipune` ∈ stem tokens → COUPLED. ✓
 *     (this repo's own live test genuinely exercises `vipune.ts`)
 *
 *   - `src/a.ts` vs `smoke-tests/test-foo.ts`
 *     subject basename: `a`; stem tokens: `foo`.
 *     `a` ∉ `{foo}` → NOT coupled. ✓
 *     (anti-false-positive: a shared token is not enough)
 *
 * One test module exercising several subjects is legitimate (this repo's own
 * `test-vipune-seam-live.ts` does exactly that): when it does NOT name any
 * single subject, the inference finds no coupling and does not flag it, which
 * is the correct behaviour — the check must not collapse every plan into N=1.

/**
 * Workstreams that split a test from the file it exercises.
 *
 * `runDevelop` fans one developer per workstream into its own worktree, so a
 * test and its subject in different worktrees provably never meet: each
 * workstream passes its own develop gate against its own tree, and the first
 * verification that sees them together is the consolidated tree at commit-pr,
 * after the full develop and adversarial spend.
 *
 * Two rules, in order:
 *
 * 1. Naming inference (the issue's stated rule): a test-named file declared
 *    by one workstream is coupled to a file in another workstream when the
 *    test's stem names that file (see `couplesTo`).
 *
 * 2. The unambiguous shape, flagged regardless of naming: a workstream whose
 *    ONLY declared file(s) look like tests of a file owned by a different
 *    workstream. A workstream that is only a test is the shape with no
 *    legitimate reading — that test is by definition about someone else's
 *    code, and it cannot run against any of it.
 *
 * Paths are normalised first (`normaliseDeclaredPath`) for the same reason as
 * `findPathCollisions`: they are prose from a planner, not `git` output.
 * A test is never paired with a workstream that ALSO declares the exact same
 * path — that is an overlap, `findPathCollisions`' job, not a split.
