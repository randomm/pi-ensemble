/**
 * work-driver-integrate — #287 Part B: the ONLY path that writes to repoRoot.
 *
 * Under always-worktree, development happens in `.worktrees/issue-<N>-<id>`
 * and repoRoot is an integration point. Every workstream's slice reaches the
 * feature branch through `integrate()`: stage in the worktree, capture the
 * staged diff, apply it onto the branch at repoRoot, commit, push.
 *
 * Concentrating repoRoot mutation here is what makes #287's acceptance
 * criterion checkable — "no git command with cwd === repoRoot between branch
 * and commit-pr" is a property of the call graph, not a convention.
 *
 * Two callers, two modes:
 *   - "create"   — commit-pr. `checkout -B <branch> <baseSha>` first, so the
 *                  branch is born at the base the worktrees were cut from
 *                  rather than at whatever repoRoot's HEAD happened to be.
 *   - "followup" — lens-fix re-integration (#287 Part C). Stays on the branch
 *                  and adds a commit. Pre-#287 lens-fix edits were made in a
 *                  worktree and nothing ever pushed them, so they never
 *                  reached the PR — a latent bug this structure removes.

 *
 * `integrate()` below mutates all three. Two concurrent groups doing that
 * corrupt each other in ways that are silent rather than loud:
 *
 *   - `checkout -B` carries a dirty index ACROSS branches, so B's applied-but-
 *     uncommitted slice moves onto A's branch and A's commit ships B's code
 *     under A's `Fixes #N`;
 *   - `git apply --index` contends on `index.lock` and surfaces as a phantom
 *     "patch conflict", routing a healthy group to handoff;
 *   - `git rev-parse HEAD` after the commit can read a SIBLING's commit, and
 *     the worktree `reset --hard` that follows then destroys this group's work.
 *
 * Two layers, because one Pi process is not the whole story: `/work` is
 * fire-and-forget and `ctx.isIdle()` reports idle immediately after launch, so
 * a second `/work` — or a second Pi process on the same clone — can already
 * race today. The promise chain is the fast path within a process; the
 * lockfile is the cross-process backstop.
