 */

/**
 * PR16 — Deterministic multi-issue grouping.
 *
 * For /work N M P with K > 1 activeIssues, partition them into groups
 * that will each become one worktree + one PR. The compiled driver's
 * PR10 shortcut bundled ALL K issues into ONE PR; that empirically
 * failed 3× (vipune `37219c9a`). PR15 retreated to one-PR-per-issue.
 * PR16 restores the old PM-driven /work's smarts (analyze → group
 * related issues → parallelize independent ones) but codified as pure
 * code so it's deterministic and testable.
 *
 * Rules, applied first-match-wins per issue-pair, union-find into
 * groups:
 *
 *   R1 — Explicit link markers: regex on issue bodies for
 *        "depends-on: #N", "companion-to: #N", "blocks #N",
 *        "blocked-by: #N". Directed edge; both directions merge.
 *   R2 — Path-overlap ≥ 50% (Jaccard): parse file paths from body
 *        fenced code + bullet lists; ≥ 0.5 overlap → same group.
 *   R3 — Explicit SPLIT marker (anchored at line start):
 *        "Split: true", "Split: yes", "Split: separate", or
 *        "This work must ship separately" → force the containing
 *        issue into its own singleton group even if R1/R2 would have
 *        merged it. (#312 — bare word "independent" removed due to
 *        high false-positive rate in prose).
 *   R4 — Subsystem tag prefix in title: [frontend], [docs], etc.
 *        Same-prefix issues group together, absent R3.
 *   R5 — Default: separate groups.
 *
 * Guardrails after grouping:
 *
 *   - Cap group size at MAX_ISSUES_PER_GROUP (3) — bigger groups
 *     approach the adversarial convergence wall (vipune `37219c9a`
 *     empirical ceiling: > 3 issues in one bundle collapsed 3×).
 *     Excess splits into per-issue singletons.
 *   - K > MAX_PARALLEL_GROUPS (2) triggers "sequential" fanout mode
 *     for the remainder (matches worktree cherry-pick ceiling from
 *     vipune `55fca4bf`).
 *
 * Output shape matches `parseWorkstreams`: `Record<groupId, {id, scope,
 * paths, outOfScope, issues}>`. Each entry becomes one workstream
 * downstream — the rest of the driver iterates
 * `Object.keys(workstreams)` unchanged.
