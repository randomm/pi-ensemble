 * Project-local scratch directory for ephemeral /work artefacts (diff
 * snapshots between adversarial rounds, captured screenshots, one-off
 * verification scripts, analysis outputs).
 *
 * Background: PR #239 live-tested on nessie issue #553 left 12+ dot-
 * prefixed diff files (`.pr503_r2.diff`, `.regate-512.diff`, etc.) in the
 * repo root, plus PNG screenshots, e2e scenario scripts, a 2.3 GB ELF
 * core dump, and a scratch test_string_error.rs at root. Causes:
 * agents improvised "save diff between rounds" with arbitrary names, and
 * the project's .gitignore didn't anticipate. The next /work's branch
 * step ABORTed correctly ("working tree is not clean") — but PR #239
 * lacked B3 (ABORT detection) so the abort was swallowed.
 *
 * PR2 fold-in: driver creates `<repoRoot>/tmp/issue-<N>/` on cycle
 * start, adds `tmp/` to `.git/info/exclude` (per-clone, NOT a committed
 * `.gitignore` entry — exclusion is local tooling concern, not project
 * shape), and tells every dispatched subagent via its prompt where to
 * write scratch. Convention: this path OR /tmp; never repo root, never
 * tracked dirs unless committing.
 *
 * Cleanup policy: on `merged` (success) the driver removes the dir.
 * On `handoff` or `aborted`, KEPT so the user can inspect what the
 * agents produced when something went wrong.
