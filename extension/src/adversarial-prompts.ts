/**
 * adversarial-prompts — what each half of the loop is told.
 *
 * Measured on nessie #664's five real spawns, the information flow was:
 *
 *   round 1 reviewer  — the diff, plus a one-sentence context
 *   round 1 fixer     — the reviewer's *entire reply* as "findings", including
 *                       mid-task narration. No diff. No issue.
 *   round 2 reviewer  — the round-1 diff again, unchanged
 *   round 2 fixer     — round-2 findings only; round 1's absent
 *   round 3 reviewer  — the round-1 diff again
 *
 * Two consequences, both observed:
 *
 *   1. The reviewer had no anchor. It noticed the staleness itself — *"The
 *      diff's original bugs … were already fixed in the working tree"* — and
 *      recovered by reading the live worktree, which is why every round found
 *      new ground instead of repeating. But a reviewer with no record of what
 *      it objected to last time cannot recognise convergence; it just keeps
 *      finding narrower things until the rounds run out.
 *   2. Nobody saw the issue. #664's explicit constraint ("must reuse
 *      `parse_assumptions` at src/synthesizer/parsing.rs:42-61") survived all
 *      three rounds unflagged, while a low-probability edge case blocked the
 *      cycle. Generic code quality was all anyone was given, so generic code
 *      quality is what got graded. This is #278.
 *
 * The issue body is optional throughout: cycles resumed from older state files
 * have no `issueBodyArtifact`, and a missing spec must degrade to the old
 * behaviour rather than putting the string "undefined" in front of a reviewer.

Attack this implementation. Find edge cases, security holes, race conditions, API misuse, flawed assumptions. Run lint/type/test if any. Return a verdict line at the end exactly matching one of:
  VERDICT: APPROVED
  VERDICT: MINOR_OBSERVATIONS
  VERDICT: ISSUES_FOUND
  VERDICT: CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND

Use the severity your role prompt defines. Only CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND blocks the commit; the others are recorded and carried into the pull request. Inflating a finding's severity to avoid approving is the worst failure mode of this role.${issueSection(opts.issueBody)}
