/**
 * F1 loop detector (#543) — streak-based repeated tool-call detection over a
 * child Pi's `message_end` event stream.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-25: long-dispatch cost concentrates in LOOP runs, not long
 * work. Three pathology transcripts — a 692-turn developer re-running `sh -n`
 * across drifting paths, a 507-turn lens running `grep X | grep -v X` (always
 * empty) 223 times, and a 106-turn explore repeating one `git show` 19x — all
 * silent-on-stdout, so the inactivity watchdog (which watches stdout bytes
 * only) provably never fires. Healthy runs finish in ≤119 turns.
 *
 * Design constraints, each load-bearing:
 *
 *   - **Streak counter, not sliding window.** The 223-grep cluster had ~286
 *     silent turns BETWEEN repeats; a sliding window would never see 10
 *     in-frame. A since-last-distinct streak does.
 *   - **Full block list per `message_end`.** A single assistant turn can
 *     carry two identical toolCall blocks; each counts. `progress.ts`'s
 *     `latestToolName` is overwritten per block and cannot be used.
 *   - **Ops-role children are EXEMPT.** ops runs deterministic git/gh;
 *     capping them manufactures partial-state incidents. The caller (spawn.ts)
 *     skips creating the detector for role === "ops".
 *   - **Path-redaction via first-seen registry.** Each distinct absolute
 *     path the detector has seen is assigned its own placeholder token in
 *     first-seen order (`<P1>`, `<P2>`, …). This is the literal reading of
 *     the spec: "each distinct absolute path → a single placeholder token".
 *     It makes fixture (d) pass: `ls /a/b` x10 → `ls <P1>` x10; `ls /c/d`
 *     x10 → `ls <P2>` x10 — different fingerprints, streak resets, NO
 *     trigger. The 692-run shape (`sh -n /tmp/x/v1.sh` then `sh -n
 *     /tmp/x/v2.sh`) produces two different tokens and does NOT trigger
 *     under this normalization — see the Open Question "Var-substitution /
 *     similarity in normalization" in the issue for the deferred follow-up
 *     that closes this gap. The PRIMARY pathology (223-grep, identical
 *     args) is caught by exact-match on the redacted fingerprint.
 *   - **Streaks are counted, not timed.** The grace window for the kill
 *     lives in the caller (spawn.ts) because it is wall-clock; this module
 *     is a pure function so fixtures can inject time.
 *
 * The caller feeds the detector via `observe()` (wired into
 * `progress.ts ingestEvent`, which sees every assistant `message_end` with
 * the FULL content block list) and consults `current()` for the structured
 * evidence to attach to the kill.
