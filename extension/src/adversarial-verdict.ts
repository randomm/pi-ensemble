/**
 * adversarial-verdict — what the reviewer said, and what it costs.
 *
 * Split out of `adversarial.ts` because the decision it encodes turned out to
 * be the whole bug, and a decision that consequential deserves to be readable
 * and directly testable rather than inlined in a dispatch loop.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * `agents-base/adversarial-developer.md` defines four verdicts and calls two of
 * them non-blocking:
 *
 *     CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND — blocking
 *     ISSUES_FOUND          — "Should address, not blocking"
 *     MINOR_OBSERVATIONS    — "Non-blocking, author's discretion"
 *     APPROVED              — clean
 *
 * The loop knew three of them and exited only on `APPROVED`. So the verdict the
 * doctrine calls *not blocking* halted the cycle, and `MINOR_OBSERVATIONS` —
 * absent from the enum — failed to parse, fell through to the `ISSUES_FOUND`
 * default, and was punished as a malfunction.
 *
 * Measured over 253 loops from the durable session store: 49 ended REJECTED,
 * and 41 of those 49 (83.7%) ended on `ISSUES_FOUND`. Eight ended on
 * `CRITICAL`. A loop still alive at the last round was roughly 2:1 to be
 * rejected — not because the code was bad, but because a reviewer told to
 * "attack this implementation" will always find *something*, and anything was
 * enough.
 *
 * nessie #664 is the worked example: its final round wrote "quality gates pass
 * … the overall design is sound", filed one item under `### ISSUES` and the
 * rest under `### MINOR_OBSERVATIONS`, and returned `ISSUES_FOUND`. The cycle
 * died with green tests, no commit and no PR.
 *
 * ## What replaces it
 *
 * Mid-loop, anything unresolved earns a fix round — that is what rounds are
 * for, and #664's rounds 1 and 2 produced real fixes. At the last round only
 * `CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND` blocks. Everything else passes, carrying its
 * outstanding findings to the PR body and into the six-lens review at step 7,
 * which applies the project's own configurable threshold. Nothing is waved
 * through silently; it is handed to the gate with more information.
