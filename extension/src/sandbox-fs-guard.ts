/**
 * Sandbox FS guard — symlink-traversal mitigation for `pi-ensemble` sandbox mode.
 *
 * Background: even Anthropic's reference devcontainer for Claude Code shipped a
 * symlink-traversal escape (CVE-2026-39861, fixed in 2.1.64). The pattern: a
 * sandboxed agent creates a symlink inside the bind-mounted workspace that
 * points OUTSIDE it (e.g. `/workspace/escape -> /etc`), then reads/writes
 * through that symlink. The container's filesystem isolation doesn't catch
 * this because the symlink is resolved on the host side of the bind mount.
 *
 * Mitigation: when PI_ENSEMBLE_SANDBOX_MODE=1, intercept every tool_call that
 * carries a filesystem path argument and refuse paths that — after
 * `realpath`-canonicalisation — fall outside the workspace root. The
 * permission-guard short-circuits in sandbox mode, so THIS interceptor is the
 * only layer in front of disk I/O. Keep it tight.
 *
 * Heuristic: scan a small set of argument names commonly used for paths
 * (`path`, `file_path`, `cwd`, `dir`, `target`) plus any string that begins
 * with `/` and resolves to outside `/workspace`. Reject with a clear reason
 * the model can react to.
 *
 * Not in scope: bash command parsing. Bash is intentionally open in sandbox
 * mode — the model can `cat /etc/passwd` directly via bash if it wants, and
 * the container's standard filesystem permissions handle that (vscode user
 * has read on /etc/passwd, no write). The guard only catches the bind-mount
 * escape via symlinks created INSIDE /workspace.
