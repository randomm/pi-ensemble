/**
 * renderer — the PURE FUNCTION at the heart of the /agents-md feature.
 *
 *     renderAgent({ facts, ledger, preamble, version }) -> bytes
 *
 * ## Why pure is the whole design
 *
 * Idempotency — the property that makes a regenerator safe to run on a live
 * repo — is a theorem about the renderer, and it is only provable when the
 * renderer is a function of its inputs alone. No `Date.now()`, no
 * `Math.random()`, no map-iteration-order dependence, no LLM call, no file
 * reads. Feed the same `(facts, ledger, preamble, version)` twice and you get
 * the same bytes, and the idempotency test asserts exactly that with
 * `Buffer.equals`.
 *
 * The timestamp problem is the one that would otherwise make this impure: the
 * decision ledger needs a date stamp. The resolution is that the date is a
 * *caller-supplied* part of the ledger (each `LedgerRow.date`), not a value the
 * renderer computes. So the pure core stays pure, and the idempotency test
 * renders with a fixed ledger and gets byte-identical output. (The ledger is
 * the one section whose bytes legitimately change between runs; everything the
 * renderer derives from `facts` is stable.)
 *
 * ## Omit-and-ledger, never invent
 *
 * A section is emitted only when detection can derive it. A section whose
 * facts are absent is **omitted**, and a `[auto]` ledger row records
 * `section omitted: <reason>`. The renderer never writes a gate command it was
 * not given — "never write a command you cannot prove runs" is enforced here
 * by only emitting `facts.commands`, and validated at write time by check.ts.
