/**
 * work-driver-branch-ops — ops-dispatch fallback for the branch step.
 *
 * Extracted from work-driver-branch-develop.ts (500-line gate, #475).
 * Owns everything the LLM ops fallback uses: the `## Worktrees` reply
 * parser, the post-dispatch git verification, and the mainline guard.
 * `runBranch` calls this after `mechanizedBranchSetup` throws something
 * other than `DirtyWorktreeError` — the recovery path #287 kept
 * deliberately: absorbing environment variance, not an opt-out.
 *
 * #533 — this path does NOT provision the worktrees it records: only
 * `worktreeCreate` (the mechanized path) calls `provisionWorktree`, and the
 * ops prompt only tells ops to `git worktree add`. A worktree without
 * `node_modules` fails the develop gate with module-not-found errors even
 * though the diff is fine, and the handoff's "add or fix `.pi/worktree-setup`"
 * advice then blames a hook that was never on the code path. The fallback is
 * an env-variance recovery, not an opt-out of provisioning — if it fires, run
 * the project's `.pi/worktree-setup` hook (or the symlink loop's equivalent)
 * in each worktree before the develop step.
