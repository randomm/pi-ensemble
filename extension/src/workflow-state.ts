/**
 * /work workflow state — schema v1.
 *
 * The state file is the durable contract that lets the work-driver:
 *   1. resume a /work cycle that crashed mid-flight (e.g., overnight session
 *      went sideways, Pi got killed, machine rebooted),
 *   2. preserve enough structural facts for the user to intervene
 *      surgically when subagent providers degrade ("switch developer to
 *      cerebras, retry step develop"),
 *   3. tell the driver what the current step is + what to do next, without
 *      asking the LLM.
 *
 * Lives at `<project>/.pi/work-state/<issue>.json`. Matches the existing
 * `.pi/permissions.json`, `.pi/decisions.json` convention (gitignored, project-
 * scoped, survives `git worktree remove`). One file per /work cycle.
 *
 * ## Schema shape
 *
 * **Discriminated union**: `pipelineState` (the reconstructed-on-read
 * snapshot of "where are we right now") + `eventLog` (append-only log of
 * typed events). Why both:
 *
 * - `pipelineState` is fast O(1) "what step are we on, what's blocking" —
 *   driver reads it on resume without replaying the whole log.
 * - `eventLog` is the source of truth for *what happened* — every dispatch,
 *   every cap-hit, every adversarial verdict. New event types are additive;
 *   new fields don't break old readers.
 *
 * On every transition the driver appends to `eventLog` THEN mutates
 * `pipelineState`. Both writes go through `writeState()` which atomically
 * replaces the JSON file. If `pipelineState` drifts from what the event log
 * implies (rare — bug or external edit), the driver should detect it and
 * either repair or surface a loud error; the eventLog is authoritative.
 *
 * ## Versioning
 *
 * `schemaVersion: 1` is MANDATORY from day 1. The reader rejects mismatched
 * versions LOUDLY rather than auto-migrating — see `assertSchemaVersion()`.
 * The recovery affordance is documented in `docs/troubleshooting.md`:
 *   - inspect the file
 *   - either resolve manually or `rm .pi/work-state/<issue>.json` to start
 *     fresh under the new schema (the user keeps their git work; only the
 *     workflow-tracker state goes).
 *
 * ## Resumability
 *
 * v1 is **observational-only**: `resumable: false` is set on every state
 * file. Resumable execution would require async-jobs to survive process
 * restart (it doesn't — jobs live in-memory). The state file lets the user
 * intervene; it does not (yet) replay completed dispatches automatically.
 * Cap-state is the explicit exception — see `pipelineState.reviewRound`
 * + `reviewCapStartedAt` — those WILL survive restart so the cap timer
 * remains coherent.
 *
 * ## GitHub-is-the-bus
 *
 * No cross-command state lookup. The GitHub issue body is the contract
 * between /plan and /work. The schema reserves an optional `upstreamRefs`
 * array for future use but the driver does not implement lookup against
 * it. Keep state intra-command.
