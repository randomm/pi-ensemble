 * How long the driver waits for the ops handoff dispatch.

 * This is NOT one of the six per-role wall-clock caps this project deleted
 * (spawn-support.ts `SPAWN_BACKSTOP_MS`). Those bounded open-ended work whose
 * duration is a function of the model, and every kill DESTROYED the work — the
 * finding both times they were raised was that the number was too small for a
 * healthy child. Neither property holds here. The handoff child's job is
 * enumerable: the markdown body is already on disk, so it runs
 * `gh <pr|issue> comment --body-file` and `gh <pr|issue> edit --add-label` and
 * reports the URL. And exceeding the bound destroys nothing — the in-process
 * `gh` fallback below posts the identical file and applies the identical
 * label, so the bound costs at most the parsed comment URL.
 *
 * The number: six real handoffs in this repo's `.pi/work-state` completed in
 * 6.7 s - 17.8 s. Eight minutes is ~27x the slowest of those, and leaves room
 * for one long thinking-heavy turn (#296: a 3-min cap SIGTERM'd this very
 * recovery path). Nothing bounded it before — nessie #626's handoff
 * `dispatch-completed` at 1547126 ms (25.8 min) never went silent, so the
 * inactivity watchdog could not see it, and the 2 h runaway backstop is 5x
 * further out again.
