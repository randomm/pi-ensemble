/**
 * work-driver-cap-killed — the shared predicate for the two new
 * dispatch-cap kill causes (#543 F1/F6) and the cap-string mapping.
 *
 * `capKilled` matches the two dispatch-cap kill causes (loop /
 * token-budget) regardless of which step emitted them. It is the
 * single source of truth for:
 *
 *   - the step-router's cap-string synthesis (develop / lens /
 *     adversarial HALT paths),
 *   - `runHandoff`'s mid-flight-halt check (these caps set
 *     `status: 'aborted'` like developer-timeout / step-failed),
 *   - `runLens`'s REVIEW_INCOMPLETE branch (a loop-killed lens is
 *     not a silent 1-of-6 loss — the cap string is recorded),
 *   - the handoff renderers' caped-partial-state gate (F5).
 *
 * The matcher takes `{ killCause }` — the shape shared by both a
 * `DispatchResult` (spawn.ts's structured kill) and a `dispatch-failed`
 * WorkEvent (the state-file record) — so the step router can feed it an
 * event without a structural cast.
