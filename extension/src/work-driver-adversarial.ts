/**
 * work-driver-adversarial — Step 5 (adversarial gate) handler.
 *
 * Extracted from work-driver.ts (issue #171 file-size hygiene). Fans out
 * one `runAdversarialLoop` call per workstream, aggregates the verdict,
 * and — on approval following a lens-fix round — commits the fix via
 * work-driver-lens.ts's `commitLensFixChanges`.
 *
 * #485/#486 — the loop's per-round verdicts and the per-workstream outcome
 * are now recorded as DATA (`adversarial-round` / `adversarial-workstream-
 * outcome` events) rather than guessed from reply prose, and a transient
 * failure in ONE workstream's loop is retried once (per-workstream budget,
 * taxonomy backoff) while the other workstreams' approved verdicts are
 * preserved in the event log either way.
