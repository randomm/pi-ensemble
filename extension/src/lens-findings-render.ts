/**
 * lens-findings-render — put the review's findings in front of the operator.
 *
 * The six-pass review produces structured findings — lens, severity, path,
 * line, title, description — and stores them on the `lens-issues-found` event.
 * Every handoff surface then threw them away: the GitHub body printed *"Review
 * the JSON findings in the state file's most recent `lens-issues-found`
 * event"* plus generic advice about patterns to look for, the in-chat message
 * printed nothing at all, and `/work-status` printed a count.
 *
 * The cost of that was measured. Across four nessie cycles the operator's PM
 * reported discovering, by reading the committed diff by hand, exactly the
 * defects the lenses had already found and reported hours earlier:
 *
 *   - a SECURITY CRITICAL on `src/config/mod.rs` — the entire config module
 *     root deleted — rediscovered as "the deleted config module";
 *   - a SIMPLICITY HIGH on `src/session/mod.rs:85` — two independent
 *     `persist_lock` mutexes — rediscovered as "the duplicate locks";
 *   - an ERROR_HANDLING CRITICAL on `src/cron/mod.rs:594` — every SIG file
 *     reprocessed each tick — refiled as a brand-new issue.
 *
 * The conclusion drawn from that was "review approval proved a weak signal".
 * The reviews were not weak. Nobody was ever shown them.
 *
 * Rendering is deliberately dense and severity-ordered: the first line a human
 * reads should be the worst thing the review found, not a pointer to a file
 * path they will not open.
