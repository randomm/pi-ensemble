/**
 * Step 2 — Plan / decompose into workstreams.
 *
 * PR3 restores the parallelism doctrine the PR #239 driver silently
 * dropped: the user's /work command treated "default to parallel" as a
 * first principle, exploiting up to 10 parallel slots for multi-
 * workstream issues (e.g., "fix bug X in frontend AND update docs"
 * would dispatch two developers in two worktrees concurrently).
 *
 * The decomposition prompt is cribbed from `pi-prompts/plan.md` Phase 2
 * — explore-shaped, structured output. The subagent reads the cached
 * issue body (from Step 1's `issueBodyArtifact`) plus the explore
 * report and decides whether the issue contains 1, 2, or N+
 * independent workstreams. Returns a fenced `## Workstreams` block
 * the driver parses.
 *
 * Single-workstream is `N=1` of the same code path (not a separate
 * branch): a `default` workstream is always written so downstream
 * code can iterate `Object.keys(workstreams)` uniformly.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *  - parsing returns 0 workstreams → write the synthetic `default`
 *  - dispatch fails → treat as halt (the cycle can't proceed without
 *    knowing what to develop); event is `dispatch-failed`
