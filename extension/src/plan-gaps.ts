 * Split out of plan-driver.ts at the same seam as forge-ci.ts / plan-draft.ts
 * (the 500-line hard limit, AGENTS.md §12). Owns:
 *
 *   - `parseGaps`: the reviewer-reply parser (GAP: markers only, verdict
 *     line, and — since this split — a `verdictParsed` flag that keeps an
 *     ABSENT verdict from silently passing as READY when CRITICAL/HIGH gaps
 *     are present (D3)),
 *   - the iteration cap: `evaluateGapGate` decides READY / one corrective
 *     round / cap-hit, and `capRouted` applies the routing policy — at the
 *     cap, zero CRITICAL/HIGH gaps FILE the spec with the residual
 *     MEDIUM/LOW gaps disclosed in a "## Residual gap-gate findings" section
 *     (D2); CRITICAL/HIGH remain → do not file, surface to the operator.
 *     Direct precedent: /work's lens round cap routes to CI instead of
 *     parking when the residuals were posted (AGENTS.md §7 "The round cap
 *     routes, it does not only stop").
