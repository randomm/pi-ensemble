 * PR19 — Mechanized commit-pr: the driver executes the consolidation +
 * commit + push + PR-creation recipe that `inlineCommitPrPrompt`
 * previously NARRATED to an LLM ops dispatch.
 *
 * Why: every worst-class incident in the harness's history (#245/#253
 * silent merges, v0.12.13 shipping 1-of-3 workstreams) was LLM ops
 * improvising these fully-enumerable operations, and the cd-chain /
 * permission-cache friction class (~22 fixes, vipune 55fca4bf) exists
 * only because an LLM emits the shell. Direct execution deletes the
 * failure source instead of detecting its failures — verifyConsolidation
 * and verifyStepOutcome remain in place downstream as the unchanged
 * correctness oracle.
 *
 * Recipe (mirrors the PR14 prompt, plus one improvement: worktree
 * slices are staged with `git add` before capture, so untracked new
 * files are included — `git diff HEAD` alone silently missed them):
 *
 *   1. Ensure repoRoot is checked out on the integration branch.
 *   2. Per worktree: verify uncommitted work exists (empty → bail to
 *      LLM fallback); for sibling worktrees stage + capture
 *      `git diff --cached` → `git apply --index` at repoRoot; for the
 *      repoRoot-as-worktree case stage porcelain paths directly.
 *   3. Commit with a templated message (issue title from the cached
 *      body artifact; `Fixes #N` per active issue; `Companion to`
 *      lines for dropped issues).
 *   4. Push; `gh pr create --body-file`; parse the PR number from the
 *      URL gh prints.
 *
 * Most failures return `{ok: false, reason}` — the caller emits a
 * plumb-report and falls back to the LLM ops dispatch (judgmental
 * recovery), whose behaviour is unchanged from PR14. The exception is
 * `terminal: true`, set when the CONSOLIDATED tree fails the project's
 * verify command: the fallback exists to absorb environment variance (an
 * apply conflict, a rejected push), and "this does not build" is a fact
 * rather than variance. Falling back there would let ops push the same
 * broken tree, making the gate one that cannot fail — #328's shape.
 * Success appends
 * the same `step-started` + `dispatch-completed` event shapes the
 * dispatch path produces (role "driver", summary carrying `pr: <N>`),
 * so parsePrNumber + both downstream gates run identically for both
 * paths.
