/**
 * File-size ratchet — AGENTS.md §12 hard limit (500 lines/file).
 *
 * §12 reads as a repo-wide rule. It was enforced over TypeScript in exactly
 * two directories, both under `extension/`. Invisible to it: `install.sh`,
 * `build.sh`, `.devcontainer/entrypoint.sh`, and every file in
 * `.github/workflows/`. `build.sh` sits at **499 lines** — one line under the
 * cap, entirely unmeasured, and the next edit would have pushed it over in
 * silence while the gate reported compliance.
 *
 * The same gap reopened for **extensionless** files: `bin/pi-ensemble` (the
 * Docker launch wrapper) is a shebang'd bash script with no extension, so an
 * extension-matched scan never saw it — it sat at 542 lines, 42 over the cap,
 * while CI reported compliance. #353 (Fedora/rootless podman support) plans to
 * edit it, and every line it added would have pushed the file further over
 * with the gate still green.
 *
 * That is the same defect class this suite keeps finding elsewhere: a gate
 * whose scope is narrower than its stated contract, so its silence reads as
 * proof. The scan is now the whole repository, and shebang'd executables are
 * in scope regardless of extension.
 *
 * **Source, not prose.** The limit is about code a person has to hold in their
 * head, so it covers `.ts`, `.sh`, workflow YAML and extensionless executables.
 * Markdown, JSON and data files are excluded deliberately, not by oversight:
 * `docs/troubleshooting.md` is 1399 lines and should be, and a 500-line cap on
 * documentation would produce a wall of noise that trains everyone to set
 * `PI_ENSEMBLE_SIZE_RATCHET=0`. A shebang is the executable's declaration of
 * "this is a program"; the execute bit alone is not (a generated data file
 * marked +x is still data), so only `#!`-prefixed files count.
 *
 * **Proven in both directions.** A gate never observed to fail is worthless —
 * nessie's own file-size ratchet shipped with three separate fail-open bugs
 * that each passed CI green, including a counter incremented inside a piped
 * `while` loop, which lives in a subshell and is therefore always zero. So
 * this asserts not only that the repo is clean but that a deliberately
 * oversized fixture IS caught — one with an extension, one extensionless.
 *
 * Escape hatch: `PI_ENSEMBLE_SIZE_RATCHET=0`.
