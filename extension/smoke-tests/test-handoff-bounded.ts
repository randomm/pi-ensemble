/**
 * S6 — writing a park comment must never cost 26 minutes.
 *
 * nessie's `.pi/work-state/626.json`: after two killed explore dispatches the
 * cycle reached handoff and logged
 * `dispatch-completed handoff ops:handoff ms=1547126` — 25.8 minutes to post a
 * comment whose body was already on disk. It COMPLETED, so neither the
 * inactivity watchdog (25 min of total silence) nor the runaway backstop (2 h)
 * bounded it; nothing did. Six healthy handoffs in this repo's own work-state
 * took 6.7 s - 17.8 s.
 *
 * The canary below is the timeout path: an ops dispatch that outlives the
 * bound must not hold the cycle hostage — the driver stops waiting and the
 * in-process `gh` fallback still produces a handoff record.
