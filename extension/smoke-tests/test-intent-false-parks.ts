/**
 * The intent gate must not park work the resolver approved.
 *
 * Measured over the 13 real resolver replies on this host — the only artifacts
 * `parseNormalisedSpec` actually consumes — **7 of 13 (54%) had the resolver say
 * `proceed` or `proceed-with-assumptions` and the gate flip them to
 * `park` / underspecified.** Two causes, both mine, both shipped in v0.12.39-40:
 *
 * 1. `blockingQuestions` (5 of the 7). I applied it to the PROCEED path for the
 *    first time in #443. Before that it had exactly one call site, inside
 *    `specIsComplete`, where it prices *overturning* a park. Pricing a decision
 *    the same as overturning one is the same mistake I already made with
 *    acceptance criteria in that PR — two existing tests caught that conjunct
 *    and nothing caught this one. `proceed-with-assumptions` exists precisely
 *    for a spec that has open questions and defensible answers.
 *
 * 2. `bullets()` matching only `^[-*]\s+` (2 of the 7). A numbered list is
 *    invisible to it, and it backs FOUR spec fields — deliverables,
 *    acceptanceCriteria, evidence and openQuestions. So a numbered spec cannot
 *    even self-rescue via #397's "a complete spec refutes underspecified" path:
 *    it parks, and parks again on retry. That is the double-park shape seen on
 *    nessie #662, whose handoff said "does not say enough to build from" while
 *    quoting its own resolver saying "the intent is clear, no contradictions".
 *
 * Note the theory this replaces: the field diagnosis was that the resolver needs
 * a literal `D{N}:` prefix. It does not — `parseDeliverables` falls back to
 * `d${i+1}` when no id matches. Hours of issue-reformatting were spent on that,
 * and 0 of 40 real issue bodies would have been fixed by it.
