/**
 * #408 — the parse-brittleness class, at the sites where a no-match produced a
 * *confident wrong answer* rather than an obvious failure.
 *
 * Each block below pairs the corrected behaviour with the exact input that
 * used to break it. Every one of these inputs is a shape an agent really
 * emits — bold markers, a capitalised token, a GitHub closing keyword — which
 * is why the misses were invisible: the fixtures were all written to match the
 * regexes, so none of them could see the defect (the pathology
 * `test-intent-real-replies.ts` documents for #397).
