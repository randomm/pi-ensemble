/**
 * A review that passes must be allowed to pass, and one whose fix never landed
 * must stop rather than read the same branch again.
 *
 * Two defects, both at the lens-review boundary, and between them they are the
 * best explanation on record for why no cycle has ever reached `ci`.
 *
 * 1. **The gate could not PASS.** `appendReviewCapHit` was called
 *    unconditionally, outside the verdict if/else, and guards only on the
 *    round number and the wall clock — never on the verdict. So a review
 *    returning APPROVED on round 3 got a `round-cap` cap-hit appended right
 *    after its `lens-approved` event, and `nextStep` — which reads the log
 *    tail — routed it to `handoff` instead of `ci`. Rounds 1-2 finding issues
 *    and round 3 approving is the ordinary success shape. This is #328's
 *    "gate that cannot fail" in mirror image, and it arrived in #457's fix for
 *    handoffs blaming the wrong gate.
 *
 *    It also double-capped `REVIEW_INCOMPLETE`: that branch appends its own
 *    `review-incomplete` cap, then got a `round-cap` on top which became the
 *    tail, so the operator was told the loop ran out of rounds when in fact a
 *    lens had failed every retry.
 *
 * 2. **A failed lens-fix integration kept the loop running.** When
 *    `integrateLensFix` returned an error the driver recorded a plumb-report
 *    and nothing else — deliberately, so that "the tail remains
 *    adversarial-approved and nextStep() routes correctly". The failure was
 *    hidden from the one consumer that could act on it. The next round then
 *    re-read `origin/<base>..origin/<branch>`, which had not moved, and
 *    re-reported the identical findings until the round cap fired. Measured on
 *    nessie #686: two full rounds after the driver had already logged that it
 *    refused to integrate. Same shape on #673 and #677.
 *
 *    The silent sibling was worse: `res.empty` mapped to `{committed:false}`
 *    with no error, so a fixer that wrote nothing produced not even a report.
