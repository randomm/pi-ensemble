/**
 * What each round of the loop is allowed to know.
 *
 * Measured on nessie #664's five real spawns, the information flow was:
 *
 *   round 1 reviewer  — the diff, plus a one-sentence context
 *   round 1 fixer     — the reviewer's *entire reply* as "findings", including
 *                       mid-task narration ("Now let me do a deep adversarial
 *                       trace"). No diff. No issue. Nothing else.
 *   round 2 reviewer  — **the round-1 diff again**, unchanged
 *   round 2 fixer     — round-2 findings only; round-1 findings absent
 *   round 3 reviewer  — **the round-1 diff again**
 *
 * `fetchDiff` ran once, before the loop (`work-driver-adversarial.ts:147`), and
 * `adversarial.ts` re-sent that same string every round. The reviewer noticed
 * by itself: *"The diff's original bugs … were already fixed in the working
 * tree."* It recovered by reading the live worktree — which is why each round
 * found new ground rather than repeating — but that made every round an
 * unanchored fresh review with no notion of what had changed since it last
 * looked, and no way to see that its earlier objections were addressed.
 *
 * And nobody in three rounds saw the issue, so #664's explicit requirement
 * ("must reuse `parse_assumptions` at src/synthesizer/parsing.rs:42-61") went
 * unflagged while a low-probability edge case killed the cycle. That is #278.
