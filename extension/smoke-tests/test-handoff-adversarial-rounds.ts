/**
 * A handoff must say what actually happened.
 *
 * nessie #664's adversarial loop ran three full rounds — three reviews, two fix
 * dispatches, twenty minutes — and the handoff comment posted to GitHub said:
 *
 *     **Rounds**: 0 of 3 review rounds
 *
 * `reviewRound` is the LENS counter; it is legitimately 0 when a cycle dies at
 * step 5 and never reaches step 7. Printing it under an adversarial cap tells
 * the reader nothing happened, when in fact everything had.
 *
 * The same comment explained the cap as "the diff still has issues the
 * adversarial-developer flagged" — without saying which — so the operator had
 * to dispatch an agent to read the transcripts and find out. The findings were
 * on the event the whole time.
