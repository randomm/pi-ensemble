/**
 * Two defects that turned recoverable blips into lost cycles, both measured
 * against real transcripts and real state files rather than reasoned about.
 *
 * ## 1. The parent hung up on a child that was about to retry itself
 *
 * Pi retries transient provider failures in-process — 3 attempts, 2s/4s/8s
 * backoff, with `"terminated"` in its retryable set — and announces the intent
 * by stamping `willRetry` on `agent_end`. `spawn.ts` closed the child's stdin
 * on *any* `agent_end`, and rpc mode exits when stdin ends. Measured on a real
 * 35-minute dispatch: exactly one error message where a 3-retry sequence would
 * have left four, and the process exited **0.4 seconds** after writing it.
 *
 * The child's retry is the one worth having: it is in-process, so it keeps the
 * accumulated context and resumes. The driver's retry re-dispatches from
 * scratch and throws the work away.
 *
 * ## 2. Fan-out failures were classified as nothing at all
 *
 * `routeStepOutcome` read only the last event. A single dispatch ends ON its
 * failure, so that worked. A fan-out does not: `runDevelop` appends a
 * `branch-completed` per workstream and then `branches-converged`, burying the
 * per-child failures.
 *
 * Measured in nessie's `673.json`: three developers hit a 429 carrying a
 * 59-second retry-after — a delay the taxonomy already waits out for single
 * dispatches, which is why both `plan` steps recovered — and develop halted
 * with `transientRetryAttempts: {}`. Never attempted, not exhausted.
