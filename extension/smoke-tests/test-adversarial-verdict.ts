/**
 * The gate must mean what its own prompt says.
 *
 * `agents-base/adversarial-developer.md:81-93` defines four verdicts and calls
 * two of them non-blocking:
 *
 *     ISSUES_FOUND       — "Should address, not blocking"
 *     MINOR_OBSERVATIONS — "Non-blocking, author's discretion"
 *
 * `adversarial.ts` knew three of them and exited only on APPROVED, so the
 * verdict its own doctrine calls *not blocking* halted the cycle, and
 * MINOR_OBSERVATIONS — absent from the enum — failed to parse, fell through to
 * the ISSUES_FOUND default, and was punished as a malfunction.
 *
 * Measured over 253 loops recovered from the durable session store: 49 ended
 * REJECTED, and **41 of those 49 (83.7%) ended on ISSUES_FOUND**. Only 8 ended
 * on CRITICAL. A loop still alive at round 3 was roughly 2:1 to be rejected.
 *
 * nessie #664 is the worked example. Its final round said "quality gates pass
 * … the overall design is sound", filed one item under `### ISSUES` and the
 * rest under `### MINOR_OBSERVATIONS`, and returned ISSUES_FOUND. The cycle
 * died with no commit and no PR.
