/**
 * #290 — plan decomposition quality + the workstream ceiling.
 *
 * Motivating incident (nessie #604): an 8.6s plan collapsed six enumerated
 * findings into ONE workstream. The developer then sprawled across 11 files,
 * looped 17 failed builds, and burned 10.5M tokens before dying. The gate is
 * deliberately arithmetic — asking the model that just under-decomposed
 * whether it decomposed well is worthless.
