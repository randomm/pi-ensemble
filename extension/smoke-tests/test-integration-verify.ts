/**
 * Nothing had ever compiled the COMBINATION before it became a PR.
 *
 * Every gate upstream sees one workstream in isolation: the develop gate runs
 * inside a single worktree, and adversarial reviews a single worktree's diff.
 * The first build of the integrated tree happened at `ci` — after `commit-pr`
 * had pushed, after the PR existed, and after six lenses had spent up to two
 * hours reviewing it. Four of nine measured nessie cycles died at lens-review;
 * none ever reached `ci`, so in practice the integrated tree was NEVER built.
 *
 * Two workstreams that each verify alone can still fail together — one renames
 * or moves what another still refers to. That defect is CREATED by integration,
 * which makes integration the only place it can be caught.
 *
 * The second half matters as much as the first. `runCommitPr` falls back to an
 * LLM ops dispatch on a mechanized failure, and that dispatch commits and
 * pushes on its own. Routing a verify failure into it would have produced a
 * textbook #328 gate-that-cannot-fail: the mechanized path refuses, ops ships
 * the identical broken tree, and the check reads as passing because nothing
 * ever reports it. So a verify failure is `terminal` and halts the cycle.
