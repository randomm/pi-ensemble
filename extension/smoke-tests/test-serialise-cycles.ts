/**
 * Concurrent cycles do not finish. Serialise them.
 *
 * Measured across 69 terminal cycles in the durable session store and 29 state
 * files: **every one of the 10 autonomous merges ran with zero other cycles in
 * flight.** No exception. Cycles that ran alongside another were ~2.4× slower
 * per role — which is what pushes a developer past the 25-minute inactivity
 * watchdog and `ops` past its cap — and two of the four nessie cycles that
 * reached commit-pr were destroyed by each other through the shared repo-root
 * integration point rather than by anything wrong with their own work.
 *
 * This reverses a previous judgement, deliberately. The old default of 3 was
 * chosen because "strict sequentiality is what made /work slow enough to be a
 * standing complaint", and 3 sat inside a band other tools use. That reasoning
 * was sound in the abstract and is contradicted by this repo's own record: a
 * cycle that never merges is not fast.
 *
 * The knob still exists. An operator who wants concurrency sets
 * `PI_ENSEMBLE_PARALLEL_GROUPS`; what changes is which way the default leans.
