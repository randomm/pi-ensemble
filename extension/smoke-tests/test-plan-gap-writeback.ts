/**
 * #639 DEFECT 2 — Decision-A writeback pipeline tests.
 *
 * The old onCorrective closure dropped the gap's status, string-prefixed the
 * resolution into openQuestions, and re-drafted; draftSpec then RE-DETERMINED
 * "resolved" via a string-prefix regex — a contradiction (the body still
 * contained the original text while the bullet claimed resolved). Decision A
 * makes the writeback real and three-branch:
 *
 *   1. body-applicable resolution (names no section, or the default
 *      Acceptance criteria) → the resolution text is appended as a NEW
 *      bullet to that section (outside Open Questions), and the Open
 *      Questions bullet renders `status: resolved` (decision owner PM).
 *   2. a resolution that explicitly names a DIFFERENT section → the bullet
 *      goes to that section.
 *   3. the parseGaps placeholder (or a resolution naming no renderable
 *      section) → the bullet renders `status: open` with
 *      `decision owner: operator`, and the body is NOT modified.
 *
 * The round-2 gate prompt must be built from the RE-DRAFTED body (the
 * reviewer sees the applied resolution) — the makeGatePrompt thunk closes
 * over the reassigned `body` binding in onCorrective; a refactor that moved
 * the re-draft into a local variable would silently break this AC.
 *
 * The single-round corrective shape only (GAP_GATE_MAX_ITERATIONS stays 2 —
 * the two-consecutive-corrective shape is unreachable and explicitly not a
 * required case, per the out-of-scope note).
 *
 * The seam wiring (makeDispatchStub / installForgeStub / gatePrompts /
 * forgeStub) lives in the shared plan-test-stubs.ts — the single copy both
 * gap-gate test files import (it used to be copied verbatim here from
 * test-plan-gap-gate-rounds.ts; a dispatch/forge shape change now updates
 * one place).
