/**
 * #479 Gate 1 — data transcription for the jq tool-classification lists in
 * build.sh.
 *
 * build.sh's two jq programs (the PM matrix branch and the specialist
 * self-only branch) each embed the same 13-key tool checklist and the same
 * 20-key MCP filter-exclusion list as literal text. Nothing keeps the two
 * copies in step: a key added to one branch and not the other renders on the
 * role prompt's **MCP:** line instead of **Tools:**, and `bun run build`
 * exits 0 — the only symptom is a subtly wrong capability block reaching a
 * subagent.
 *
 * This test asserts the *data* — that both copies are transcriptions of the
 * two expected member sets, verbatim: same members, no additions, no
 * omissions, same order. It says nothing about the surrounding jq predicate
 * (Gate 2, the byte-identical `dist/prompts/standard/` diff, covers that).
 *
 * Two shapes of build.sh exist at different points in the #479 refactor, and
 * this test must be green in **both** so it lands before the refactor,
 * proving the transcription the refactor then relies on:
 *
 * - **Baseline** (today): the sets exist as inline jq — one
 *   `then "key"` per member in the tool checklist, one `.key != "key"` per
 *   member in the MCP filter, in both branches. The test counts the inline
 *   copies against the expected sets (each member must appear exactly 2
 *   times — one per branch — or more for `*`, which is legitimately used
 *   elsewhere in the same file, e.g. the bash-default checks).
 * - **Refactored** (task-a): the sets exist once each as single-line array
 *   literals — `TOOL_KEYS='["read","write",…]'`, `NO…
 *   members, no additions, no omissions — and the inline jq copies are gone
 *   (zero `then "key"` and `.key != "key"` occurrences for every member
 *   except `*`, which the jq predicates still use directly).
 *
 * The expected sets are hardcoded here rather than read from build.sh, so
 * the test pins the transcription independently of either shape.
