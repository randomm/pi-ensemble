/**
 * Two workstreams must not be pointed at the same file.
 *
 * The plan step decomposes an issue into N workstreams, each with a declared
 * `paths` list, and `runDevelop` fans out one developer per workstream into its
 * own worktree. Nothing checked that those lists are disjoint — a repo-wide
 * grep for `overlap|disjoint|intersect` found no workstream-level check at all;
 * the only Jaccard logic groups *issues*, not workstreams.
 *
 * The collision surfaces much later as a bare `git apply` failure during
 * commit-pr consolidation — a HALT step, after the full develop and adversarial
 * spend, with an error that says nothing about why two workstreams wanted the
 * same file.
 *
 * Not hypothetical: measured on this host, current cycles are routinely N>1
 * (nessie 664 = 3 workstreams, 673 = 2, 677 = 3).
 *
 * This is a plan-quality defect of exactly the shape `planQualityReason`
 * already models, so it becomes a third reason and inherits the existing
 * one-shot corrective re-dispatch. The planner can re-split; a halt would be
 * more code and a worse outcome.
