/**
 * #376 — the grouping rules, run against REAL issue bodies.
 *
 * The existing grouping tests use synthetic fixtures written to match the
 * regexes, so all four rules passed while four of them did nothing on the
 * actual backlog. These fixtures are `gh issue view --json number,title,body`
 * captured verbatim from this repo's own issues, which is the only input shape
 * that could have caught:
 *
 *   - R3/R4 seeing one line of compact JSON (so `^` under /m never matched),
 *   - R3's literal not being the sentence anyone writes,
 *   - R4 needing `[tag]` where /plan mandates `feat: ` prefixes,
 *   - R2 demanding a directory component where issues write `module.ts:1274`.
 *
 * Measured before the fix: R3 fired on 0 of 7; path extraction returned 0 for
 * 5 of 7.
