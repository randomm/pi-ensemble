/**
 * Corrective-round and residual-union tests for the /plan gap gate.
 *
 * Split out of test-plan-gap-gate.ts (500-line hard limit). These tests
 * exercise the two fixes from the CRITICAL-only terminal rule follow-up:
 *
 *   - NO-OP ROUND ELIMINATED: a round-1 reply with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW and
 *     NEEDS_ITERATION must result in exactly ONE gate dispatch (the
 *     corrective branch would iterate over an empty blocking array,
 *     producing a byte-identical body — a provably useless second round).
 *   - CRITICAL STILL ITERATES: a round-1 CRITICAL must still produce two
 *     gate dispatches (the corrective round fires only when blocking is
 *     non-empty).
 *   - UNION DISCLOSURE: with a CRITICAL at round 1 (so a corrective round
 *     fires) plus non-blocking findings in both rounds, the filed body's
 *     residual section contains findings from BOTH rounds (the union, not
 *     just the last).
 *   - RATCHETING (re-pointed): a stream of fresh HIGHs can never prevent
 *     filing — the first round with zero CRITICAL is terminal (one
 *     dispatch, file with residual).
