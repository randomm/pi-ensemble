/**
 * A worktree with no dependencies cannot run the project's own commands.
 *
 * `git worktree add --detach` materialises tracked files and nothing else, and
 * the develop step then runs the project's verify command inside that tree.
 *
 * How badly that bites is language-dependent, which is why it survived:
 *
 *   - Rust (nessie): `cargo check --quiet` resolves and works — cargo rebuilds
 *     from scratch. Costs minutes per worktree per cycle, not correctness.
 *     Confirmed on nessie 677, which reached handoff with an empty
 *     `verifyEvidence`; that field is written only on failure.
 *   - Node/bun (this repo): resolves to a `bun`/`npm` command that needs
 *     `extension/node_modules`, which is gitignored — the gate fails outright.
 *     pi-ensemble dogfooding `/work` on itself could not pass its own develop
 *     gate in a worktree.
 *
 * Measured, and contradicting an earlier claim of mine that this was
 * unobserved: 20 cycles ran the mechanized branch path and 0 fell back, and
 * every 2026-08-12 cycle used a real `.worktrees/` path. The state files that
 * showed `worktrees = {default: repoRoot}` were pi-ensemble's own, all
 * pre-#287.
