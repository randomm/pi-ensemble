/**
 * A worktree with no dependencies cannot run the project's own commands.
 *
 * `git worktree add --detach` materialises tracked files and nothing else, and
 * the develop step then runs the project's verify command inside that tree.
 *
 * How badly that bites is language-dependent, which is why it survived:
 *
 *   - Rust (nessie): `cargo check --quiet` resolves and works — cargo rebuilds
 *     from scratch. Costs minutes per worktree per cycle, not correctness.
 *     Confirmed on nessie 677, which reached handoff with an empty
 *     `verifyEvidence`; that field is written only on failure.
 *   - Node/bun (this repo): resolves to a `bun`/`npm` command that needs
 *     `extension/node_modules`, which is gitignored — the gate fails outright.
 *     pi-ensemble dogfooding `/work` on itself could not pass its own develop
 *     gate in a worktree.
 *
 * #481: the symlink loop looked at `repoRoot` only, and reported a USEFUL
 * link for an EMPTY gitignored `node_modules/` at the root (which this clone
 * has), while the real 148-entry tree at `extension/node_modules` was never
 * linked. The fix makes discovery scan depth-1 package directories for
 * manifests/lockfiles, skips empty candidates before linking, and sets
 * `ProvisionResult.problem` when a lockfile-bearing project has no usable
 * tree.
 *
 * The `git check-ignore` probe goes through the injected `execFn` so the
 * three exit states (0 = ignored, 1 = not-ignored, ≥2 = git error) are each
 * observable: a rejection with `err.code === 1` reads as NOT-IGNORED, and a
 * rejection with `err.code >= 2` (or no `.code`) reads as GIT-ERROR, both of
 * which mean the candidate is refused. Pre-#481 both collapsed to one state,
 * which let a tracked directory be shadowed by a link to elsewhere. Every
 * fixture therefore creates a real git repo, writes a `.gitignore`, commits
 * a tracked file, and leaves the candidate dependency directory untracked
 * (as it would be after `bun install`).
