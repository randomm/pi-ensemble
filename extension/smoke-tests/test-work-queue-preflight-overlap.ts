/**
 * #676 — the pre-dispatch group-overlap gate for runWorkQueue.
 *
 * The regression this locks down: `/work N M` where groupIssues() places N
 * and M in SEPARATE groups (below the 0.5 Jaccard merge threshold, or an R3
 * split marker blocking the union) but whose extracted paths OVERLAP used to
 * run both groups concurrently, and only the reactive plan-time
 * checkAndRegisterClaims() parked the loser — after a full explore+plan
 * dispatch had already been burned. The gate serialises the predictable case
 * BEFORE any dispatch; the reactive check remains the safety net for the
 * genuinely unpredictable case (LLM-declared paths diverging from the
 * extracted ones).
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Two groups with overlapping groupIssues()-extracted `paths` at
 *     concurrency ≥ 2 are serialized: the second group's runGroup is not
 *     invoked before the first's cycle reaches a terminal state.
 *   - Disjoint groups (or groups with empty `paths`) are NOT serialized —
 *     the peak-concurrency invariant of the #289 pool test holds.
 *   - A deferred group is still claimed, still classified through the same
 *     merged/parked/halted pipeline, and never left unreported.
 *   - A systemic halt while a sibling is in flight still drains the sibling
 *     before the queue stops; the deferred group is then reported
 *     not-started.
 *   - Real fixtures (289.json + 368.json): groupIssues() places them in
 *     separate singleton groups whose extracted paths share a token, so the
 *     gate predicts serialization for this real pair end-to-end.
 *
 * No Pi spawn, no fs, no issue bodies — a pure queue-behaviour test over
 * the injected runGroup stub, following test-work-queue-dlq.ts conventions.
